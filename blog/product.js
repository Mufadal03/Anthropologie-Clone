        Reducing our overall single-use plastic waste from entering landfills and the environment is incredibly important to us. URBN has partnered with Trex, an eco-friendly composite decking manufacturer, to repurpose our current plastic polybags, DTC mailers, and other plastic film for future use. This program has been rolled out to all UO and FP stores in the lower 48 states (over 340 stores) and has recycled over 100 tons (approx. 195,000 lbs. of plastic) to date.

Additionally, we are committed to reducing our virgin and single use plastic throughout our supply chain. As of March 2022, All EU and UK bound units are contained in 100% post consumer recycled and recyclable plastic polybags. 5-10% of all brand units are shipping in autobags, comprised of 30% recycled material. 90% of all brand units are shipped in reusable mailers comprised of 100% post-industrial plastic waste and are fully recyclable.
